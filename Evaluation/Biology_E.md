[[Neuronal Resolution]]:
	The [[Modes]] must be tested respectively as and when an activity that requires it is concerned and may be done by applying a [[combination]] of [[Modes]] which complement the concerned mode i.e. are (dynamically) predefined before evaluation and do not impede on the concerned mode. This may be done by forming [[Tunnels]] for the complements that may be used in the future i.e. archived and letting the primary mode be free for entropic evaluation.
	[Creations , A skeleton (usually another mode for which a tunnel exists) of what the primary mode needs to pass,  Establishing a certain confidence interval by gradually increasing the neural spread by starting from a skeleton of an idea and adding different modes to it ]

The Creations must have passed the test of [[Entropic hierarchy]].
	This could one of ones' own creations or the ones matching/surpassing either the Neural Spread or the Entropic hierarchy of the ones utilized in the past 
The skeleton must be far reaching as mentioned under [[Neural Spread]]. 
	The skeletons may be used up until the point of complete saturation, the event which shall conclude its use and have it archived (if required in the future). I see now point trying to start base up on the same idea every time.  A Number of skeletons may exist and may be built upon slowly as and when its need should arise

Tempo/Resonance, Resonance Tunnels, Reduced sensitivity of The neural cells/ Fatigue.

Tempo/Resonance:
	The Speed at which these thoughts occur may directly correlate to the kind of hormones flooding the system and may require some kind of an analogue which starts from base down [[Biological hierarchy]] and permits the use of  [[Neural Cell#Inhibition]] and [[Neural Cell#Intervention]]. 
	Under the same premise one may understand efficiency as a [[Neural Cell#Inhibition]] for certain [[domains]] and may require a shift to a distant set of [[Base]]s focuses on a different kind of [[Engagement]].
