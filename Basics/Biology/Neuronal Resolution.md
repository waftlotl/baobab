The point at which two different sensory inputs collimate to appear as a conglomeration of the properties of the two as specified under reaction between [[Neural Cell]](s).
It may take on different resolutions during the use of different [[Domains]].

Resolution cap allows for breakdown of nodes into smaller ones invisible to the memories' eye. This may add more complexity and may make anything far more provocative considering the right resonance [[Mode]].
The ability to be able to derive finer resolution from a crude low resolution node (define the entropy however you shall) may ultimately work as a benchmark for whether or not one practices "good thought".
