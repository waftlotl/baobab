Receptors may exist either on the transmitting neuron or on the receiving neuron.
**Transmitting Neuron:**
If and when a certain threshold is reached, the measure that dictates the deciding is done not by the transmitting neuron but the receiving neuron. This probably ensures redundancy to avoid data loss. 

**Receiving Neuron:**
Receiving Neurons receive different hormones at different [[sensitivity]] levels and change the receptivity towards a certain neuron based on its abundance or the lack of it.
Some points to consider:
	There is no constraint on where the inhibitory signal ought to come from.
	The exploitation of these systems involve either working with either of the following:
		Optimization of the transmission system.
		External Quantity tweaking of the quantity of hormones.
		Tweaking of the messenger medium for the inhibitory signal .
		Tweaking the [[sensitivity]] of neurons through certain measures that still need to be discovered. #research

Along these same lines one may derive the workarounds that constrain [[Base]]

# Inhibition:
The massive turn off concerning a Receiving Neuron that's surrounded by excited ones after a certain Threshold Period. 

# Intervention:
The use of generated inhibitory signals
The production of highly impacting stimulants that catalyse the Current process; This may be done by increasing the specific hormone production through natural/artificial means. [natural mostly]
Abstaining of the production of the specific hormone to increase the receptivity of the [[node]]s upon completing a threshold period. 
Care must be taken as to not to overuse the above tools and proceed gradually rather than brute forcing an emotion/ hormone which may desensitize the domains. Careful lack of it must take place to sensitize the hormones towards mor

# Saturation:
It may refer to the point where the [[node]] (here, a certain spread of neurons) has reached the maximum entropy allowed by the respective ones' head. The information which may exist under a certain [[node]] may be present in different [[Mode]]s.
