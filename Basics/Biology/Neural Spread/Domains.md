being the names given to combinations of certain functions of the head and location revealing the proximity of one domain to another. The hormones that work inside the head work at all places at the same time, just with different sensitivities.

Points:
	The key is to consider how to activate domains with a higher [[sensitivity]] without causing fatigue. probably do-able by trying to associate domains with a given kind of hormone every time it is provoked as placed under [[Neural Cell#Intervention]]. #research 
	Specific liking towards a certain domain must agree with the rules placed under [[Biases]]
	and must not impede on the [[Neural Spread]] of ones' mind.
