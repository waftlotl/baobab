Theories must not  
[[Rule1]] Oversimplify

[[Rule2]] Paint a probable picture only if :
	[[Rule2_1]] The ideas concern the evolution or devolution rather, of time.
	[[Rule2_2]] They do not set an expectation value that impedes on the Axioms set by [[Base]], 
	[[Rule2_3]] if they help [[To Absorb]] and [[To Apply]] only if paired up with the former. This makes sure that the circumstances of Reality and the Abstractions do not trace a destructive and regressive path for oneself.  

[[Rule_3]] Be a crude analogue of an existing fundamental

[[Rule_4]] Prevents the formation of newer theories, memories, or knowledge.

[[Rule_5]] Overfit and make [[Specific]] the only [[Fundamental]] that one utilizes while performing any of the functions under [[Base]]

[[Rule_6]] To Afflict change onto the document: Reasons must be written, reviewed and change finally enforced. State of mind must be open, diverse and without external stimuli
[[Rule_7]] A log must be kept ensuring necessary coverage across all fields and prioritizing some over others.
