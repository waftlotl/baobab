Analogies are hard to define. The presence of its purposes may not be sensed in its excerpt; Its understood meaning, however, is.
Upon deriving certain [[Variables]] or [[Relations]] between different objects (or concepts) and building a story, that may be fulfil any of the axioms under [[Base]] given that they do not disagree with [[Filter]] when some of these axioms are carried out.
A point that may be noted is that the properties of a certain object needn't even be considered. This problem, however, is mitigated with the use of the Correlation factor under [[Relations]] which dictates that even the absence of a certain property may be defined under it (namely, Relations).
